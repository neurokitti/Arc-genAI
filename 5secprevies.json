Read on to find over 30 easy soup recipes I'll be making all fall and winter long.\n[fall] / [winter] — [Jump to recipe] ![]\n#### ![best soup recipes]\n**Soup season is here!** There’s a lot to love about fall—beautiful weather, changing leaves, [cozy baked goods], and [hot drinks]—but the soup recipes are hands down my favorite part.\nI _adore_ soup. I love making it, I love eating it, and I love packing up the leftovers so that I can enjoy it again the next day. When I’m stressed, I turn to soup because I find it meditative to cook. When I’m snowed in, I turn to it because I keep a stash stored away in my freezer. And when I’m in need of a healthy reset, I turn to it because it just makes me feel good inside.\nTo celebrate the start of soup season, I’m sharing my best tips for making soup recipes, as well as 35 of my favorite soups and stews. In addition to classics like French onion and butternut squash soup, you’ll find a host of inventive, veggie-forward soup recipes like zucchini soup with coconut and basil and a creamy white bean chili. I love them all, and I hope that you will too.\n## Best Tips for Making Soup Recipes\n1. **Season to taste. **Raw vegetable ingredients need seasoning, and [vegetable broths] vary in salt level. If your soup is bland, don’t hesitate to add generous pinches of salt and lots of fresh black pepper. Taste as you go!\n2. **Drizzle with olive oil. **I always finish soups with a generous drizzle of olive oil. It adds richness and makes the flavors sing.\n3. [**Save some for lunch!**] Soup often tastes better on the second day, so be sure to make enough to have leftovers. Most soup recipes also freeze well for up to a few months. Check out [this post] for my best freezing tips!\n4. **Spice to your level. **Customizing your soup is the fun, creative part of cooking soup recipes. If you’re making a recipe that calls for lots of spice but you prefer milder flavors, start with less. If you like things spicy, add more! Taste as you cook, and adjust the flavors to make something you really love.\n## Favorite Autumn Soup Recipes\nIn Chicago, soup season lasts from September to…well, way later than it should. I make soup recipes the whole way through, but I especially crave them now, in the heart of autumn. These 5 easy soup recipes are my favorites at this time of year. They’re cozy, comforting, and/or filled with aromatic flavor from herbs like rosemary, sage, and thyme.\n![Butternut squash soup]\n#### [Butternut Squash Soup]\nGinger, rosemary, and sage fill this soup with cozy autumn flavor. Lightly creamy, warming, and nourishing, it’s my go-to recipe for a cool fall night.\n![Wild rice soup]\n#### [Creamy Wild Rice Soup]\nIt might not look like it, but this soup’s base isn’t made with dairy. Instead, it gets its creamy texture from blended white beans, cashews, and savory miso paste.\n![Cream of mushroom soup]\n#### **[Creamy Mushroom Soup]**\nDon’t even think about adding this cream of mushroom soup to your next [green bean casserole]! Brimming with rich, savory flavor, it’s meant to be enjoyed all on its own.\n![Potato leek soup]\n#### [Potato Leek Soup]\nIf you see a bunch of beautiful fall [leeks] at the farmers market or store, snatch them up to make this recipe.

Seasonings like smoked paprika, chipotles in adobo sauce, and fresh and dried chiles fill these hearty soup recipes with bold flavor.\n![Vegetarian chili]\n#### [Easy Vegetarian Chili]**\n**\nDo we count chili as a soup? I’m on the fence, but I still had to include this recipe here. It’s super quick and easy to make, and on a cold night, its smoky/spicy flavor will warm you up in no time.\n![Corn chowder]\n#### [Corn Chowder]\nYou can make this recipe two ways. Add heavy cream for a classic chowder, or blend in cashews for a luxe dairy-free twist.\n![White bean chili with cilantro and avocado]\n#### [**White Bean Soup**]\nThis white bean soup is my spin on creamy chicken chili (minus the chicken, of course). Green chiles and fresh lime juice fill it with addictive zingy flavor.\n![Creamy potato soup - easy Soup Recipes]\n#### [**Creamy Potato Soup**]\nCan comfort food be…healthy? This recipe answers with a resounding, “YES!” It’s thick, creamy, and packed with smoky flavor, but it’s entirely plant-based.\n![Tortilla soup topped with avocado, radishes, and crispy tortilla strips]\n#### [Vegetarian Tortilla Soup]\nPotentially one of my all-time favorite soup recipes!

It’s delicious on its own, but I like it even more with crispy, smoky [coconut bacon] on top!\n## Easy Blended Soup Recipes\nTraditional puréed soup recipes commonly call for butter, heavy cream, or whole milk, but you won’t find any of those ingredients in the creamy soups below. Instead, blended vegetables give each one its smooth, velvety texture. Yum!\n![Acorn squash soup]\n#### [Acorn Squash Soup]\nButternut isn’t the only squash that can blend into a delicious soup!\n![Homemade Tomato soup recipe]\n#### [Tomato Basil Soup]\nThis rich, savory soup stars roasted fresh tomatoes instead of canned ones. I love to make it in late summer to preserve the last tomatoes of the season. It freezes perfectly!\n![Sweet potato soup]\n#### [**Sweet Potato Soup**]\nTwo bowls for me, please!

Still, we’re nowhere near tired of it. Spices like turmeric, ginger, cumin, and cardamom pack it with warm curry flavor.\n![Curry Lentil Soup]\n#### [Curry Lentil Soup]\nIf you open your pantry, you’ll likely find all the ingredients to this bright, warming, and weeknight-friendly lentil soup inside. It’s one of our favorites and a fan favorite, too!\n![Coconut carrot gazpacho]\n#### **[Carrot Coconut Soup]**\nI think of this recipe as a “gazpacho” because it comes together easily in the blender. Chill it if you want to eat it [gazpacho]-style, but if you’re craving something warm, it’s equally good after a few minutes on the stove.\n## All About the Onions\nYou’ll find onions in almost every recipe in this post, but most often, they’re playing a supporting role. In the recipes below, they’re finally front and center, filling each soup with rich flavor.\n![French onion soup]\n#### [French Onion Soup]\nThis easy French onion soup recipe will rival any you’ve had at a restaurant. Topped with crispy, cheesy baguette, it’s rich, comforting, and packed with umami flavor.\n![Best Mushroom Soup Recipe]\n#### [Oyster Mushroom Soup]**\n**\nThis brothy soup is light and nourishing, but that doesn’t mean it’s bland.
