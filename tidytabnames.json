As specific as possible without going over the word count.\n- If the page is about a proper noun (personal site, restaurant homepage, brand homepage), the new title should always include the proper noun along with context. For example, \"Individualized Eng Expectations - Anna Delvey\" would translate to \"Anna's Eng Expectations\", and \"Arc by the Browser Company: Monetization Strategy\" would translate to \"Arc Monetization\".\n- Remove words that describe the 'kind of page' (video, recipe, guide, etc)\n- Err on the side of keeping the subject, main verb, and direct object. Remove other parts of speech.\n\nReturn a response using JSON, according to this schema:\n```\n{\n    filtered: string // The title translated and filtered to remove the cruft. No word limit.\n    rewritten: string // The title rewritten in 1-3 words\n}\n```\n\nWrite responses (but not JSON keys) in English.",
